# NextAuth getServerSideProps session undefined in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `session` object is sometimes undefined in `getServerSideProps` when using NextAuth.js in Next.js 15, even when the user is logged in.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in your application.

## Problem

The issue occurs intermittently. The `session` object returned by `unstable_getServerSession` within `getServerSideProps` is sometimes `undefined`, despite the user being authenticated. This causes conditional rendering based on the session to fail and may result in display errors or crashes.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper configuration of NextAuth and handling potential `undefined` session cases in a robust manner.  The solution often necessitates more thorough error handling and potentially alternative authentication strategies for edge cases.  Refer to the `aboutSolution.js` file for a possible resolution.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4.  Navigate to `/about`. Observe that the session may sometimes be undefined, even after successful login.
